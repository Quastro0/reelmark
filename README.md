## 📱 App Description
ReelMark is a powerful app for android and ios (cross-platform) application that helps you save, organize, and manage your favorite Instagram reels. Available for both Android and iOS, ReelMark provides an intuitive interface and powerful features to make it easy to keep track of your favorite content.

## 💡 Inspiration

Scrolling through Instagram, I'd often come across reels that were helpful — like a video editing tip, a tutorial, or creative inspiration. I'd save them using Instagram's native "Save" feature, only to completely forget about them later. When I did try to find them again, I had to scroll endlessly through hundreds of saved reels — many with misleading thumbnails — making it nearly impossible to find the one I wanted.

That's when I realized: Instagram doesn't let you organize or label what you save.

So I decided to fix that.

ReelMark was born out of this simple frustration — a tool that lets you:
- Save reels with titles and tags
- Quickly search and retrieve them later
- Avoid endlessly scrolling and rewatching every saved reel

It's built to feel like your own personal Instagram reel library — searchable, organized, and fast.
